# Tableau for Data and Business Analysts

## Track Description

Boost your Tableau skills. Learn how to create easy to use dashboards with key performance indicators to track company performance and generate business insights.

Data comes in all shapes and sizes, and is not always structured to utilize Tableau its full potential. In this course you will learn how to create a Tableau friendly dataset, after which we will discover various new techniques to bring your skills to the next level. You will refresh your knowledge on the basics of aggregation, and apply this knowledge to key metrics such as Return on Investment and Year over Year growth calculations. Consecutively you will go deeper into more intermediate topics such as Level of Detail calculations, regular expressions and Tableau analytics. Finally you will expand your skills by learning how to use dynamic sets & parameters in visualizations, before combining it all to build the ultimate dashboard for your stakeholders. 

## Prerequisites 
Tableau fundamentals. This course is intended for students who have a basic understanding of Tableau. The learner is expected to know the difference between discrete and continuous time metrics, and is able to create calculated fields and different visualizations in worksheets. He or she already knows how to add these worksheets with corresponding filters to dashboards to make the data usable for stakeholders.

## Track Overview

### 1. Data structure & Data Preparation
Learn how to read in any dataset in Tableau. By understanding how Tableau reads the data you will be able to get your visualizations up in no time
#### Learning Objectives:
* Learner will be able to understand the Tableau Data Model, and the difference between joining, blending and relationships
* Learner will be able to manipulate data using the “New Custom SQL” option in the connection tab to optimize Tableau usage & performance


### 2. Calculations & Aggregations
Understanding calculations and aggregations are of vital importance to show the correct data to your stakeholders
#### Learning Objectives:
* Learner will be able to explain how aggregations, including quick table calculations, work and why different methods of calculating Return on Investment (ROI) return different results
* Learner will be able to calculate Year over Year (YoY) and Year to date (YTD) growth for different metrics, a common request in companies across industries
* Learner will be able to identify and fix a common error: “Cannot mix aggregate and non-aggregate arguments within this function”


### 3. Advanced Calculations
Advanced calculations enable you to create new visualizations and are an integral part to get everything out of your dataset
#### Learning Objectives:
* Learner will be able to apply Level of Detail (LoD) calculations and understand when to use them
* Learner will be able to use Regular Expressions to extract key insights from text fields
* Learner will be able to apply different functions such as moving average calculations

### 4. Tableau Analytics
Learn how to leverage the existing analytics functions available
#### Learning Objectives:
* Learner will be able to create boxplots and use basic statistical functions such as the standard deviation
* Learner will be able to apply the analytics functions such as regression models and clustering
* Learner will be able to understand the limitations of these functions, and will be made aware of the R/Python integration 


### 5. Dynamic Sets & Parameters in dashboards
Making our previously built visualizations dynamic will allow your stakeholders to play with the data and extract as much information as possible
#### Learning Objectives:
* Learner will be able to break down the different use cases of sets & parameters and how apply them to visualizations such as e.g. dual axis graphs
* Learner will be able to demonstrate his knowledge by combining dynamic sets with Level of Detail (LoD) calculations
* Learner will be able to show all the main key performance indicators (KPI) of a company such as ROI and Growth in one dashboard, without overcomplicating

### 6. A dashboard is a living story
A dashboard is only as successful as the people using it
#### Learning Objectives:
* Learner will be able to interpret feedback from stakeholders on requested changes
* Learner will be able to adjust the data structure behind the dashboard and understand the importance of a good data structure 
* Learner will be able to evaluate the usage of his dashboard and implement automatic extract refreshes to make the dashboard update periodically


## Addendum

### Data usage:
The course will use aggregated transactional data of an online eCommerce platform, and throughout the course the user will learn how to create the main KPIs for business reporting.

### Course refinement:
There is overlap between some of the courses above and already existing courses on Datacamp. 
* Course 1 “Data Structure & Data Preparation” partially overlaps with “Connecting Data in Tableau” on Datacamp.
* Course 5 “Dynamic Sets & Parameters to create the  ultimate dashboard” partially overlaps with “Creating Dashboards in Tableau”.

Also note in most Datacamp courses the final course is the most complicated one, but in this course it can still be decided how difficult the final course should be. The key message to transfer in this final chapter is to be open to feedback and adjust / enhance your dashboard on the needs of your stakeholders. In order to make this course a success a full deepdive of the content and comparison with existing content should be made, potentially resulting in a reshuffling of the content.
